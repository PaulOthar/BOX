# BOX ðŸ“¦
Binary Object Extended format.  
BOX is an experimental viewer/editor for `.box` files, a format designed to hold "stuff" (sprites, text blobs, data chunks, you name it) in modular blocks.  
The editor runs entirely in the browser, built with plain HTML and JavaScript, no frameworks involved.
